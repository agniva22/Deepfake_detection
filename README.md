# Impact of Feature Attributions on Different Types of Fake Face Detection
This project explores how interpretability methods impact the performance of deepfake detection across various datasets. The repository includes models and attribution techniques like SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients applied to different deepfake datasets.

## Folder Structure
|-- Celeb-DF/: Experiments and data related to the Celeb-DF dataset.

|-- FF++/: Code and results for the FaceForensics++ dataset.

|-- Fake_Face/: Handles synthetic/generated face data.

|-- LIME/, SHAP/, IG/: Implementations of interpretability methods.

|-- Models/: Contains trained model files and scripts for model training.

## Purpose
The project aims to understand how different interpretability techniques influence the understanding and detection of manipulated facial media.
